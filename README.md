# AutoStreamML

AutoStreamML is a Streamlit application designed for automated machine learning pipelines, focused on classification tasks. In the upcoming future, additional functionalities for regression and clustering applications will be added. Stay tuned for updates!

## Introduction

AutoStreamML offers functionalities for data upload, exploratory data analysis (profiling), and model building specifically tailored for classification tasks. It provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with and automate their classification tasks.

## Features

- ** üìÅ Data Upload**: Users can upload their datasets for classification analysis and model building.
- ** üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (Profiling)**: Automated generation of detailed data analysis reports using ydata-profiling.
- ** ü§ñ Machine Learning Modeling**: Streamlined model building process with PyCaret, including setup, model comparison, and saving the best model for classification tasks.
- **Model Download**: Ability to download the trained machine learning model for later use.

## Installation

To run the AutoStreamML application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit application using the command `streamlit run app.py`.

## Usage

Upon running the application, you'll be presented with a sidebar containing navigation options:

- **Upload**: Upload your dataset for classification analysis and model building.
- **Profiling**: Perform automated exploratory data analysis for classification tasks.
- **Modelling**: Build machine learning models on your dataset specifically for classification tasks.
