# AutoStreamML

AutoStreamML is a Streamlit application designed to facilitate automated machine learning pipelines using various libraries such as Streamlit, ydata-profiling, and PyCaret.

## Introduction

AutoStreamML offers functionalities for data upload, exploratory data analysis (profiling), model building, and model downloading. It provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with and automate their machine learning tasks.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Users can upload their datasets for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (Profiling)**: Automated generation of detailed data analysis reports using ydata-profiling.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Streamlined model building process with PyCaret, including setup, model comparison, and saving the best model.
- **Model Download**: Ability to download the trained machine learning model for later use.

## Installation

To run the AutoStreamML application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit application using the command `streamlit run app.py`.

## Usage

Upon running the application, you'll be presented with a sidebar containing navigation options:

- **Upload**: Upload your dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Profiling**: Perform automated exploratory data analysis.
- **Modelling**: Build machine learning models on your dataset.
- **Download**: Download the trained machine learning model.

Simply select the desired option and follow the instructions provided in the application.
